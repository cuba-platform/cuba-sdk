This list must be provided both for inter-server communication mechanism based on JGroups and for clients connecting to the cluster.\n\nThe add-on allows cluster members and clients to communicate through a  [ZooKeeper](https://zookeeper.apache.org/) instance or ensemble.

In other words, the add-on provides dynamic service discovery.\n\nFor more information, please refer to [README](https://github.com/cuba-platform/cuba-zk#cuba-zookeeper-integration-add-on) on GitHub.",

It contains a login form for entering user credentials and checks the credentials against the list of registered users. Only one Identity Provider is allowed in an SSO environment.\n*   Service Provider (SP) is a regular application that redirects to IDP for user authentication. SP should contain the same list of users as IDP (passwords do not matter though). SP provides authorization using CUBA security roles and access groups. There may be any number of Service Providers in an SSO environment.\n\nAn application can be an Identity Provider and a Service Provider at the same time, so you don’t have to setup a dedicated IDP.\n\n_CUBA SSO uses custom HTTP-based protocol and currently does not provide integration with systems using standard authentication protocols like SAML or OIDC._\n\nIn SSO environment, when a user enters a Service Provider URL, the SP redirects to the IDP page for entering login name and password. After successful authentication, IDP redirects back to the SP application and the user transparently logs in to SP.",

It also provides UI components that expose WebDAV functions to the GUI level as well as REST API that allows users to manipulate with file storage from third-party clients.\n\n## Features\n\n- Operating with documents in applications that support WebDAV (MS Office, for example) straight from the server. No need in saving manually to the local disk and uploading back to the server.\n- Visual components to work with files and versions for the generic CUBA UI.\n- Full support for collaborative work and file versioning, manageable both from the client application and CUBA UI.\n- Configurable conflict resolution policies.\n- Simple management of file access control via full integration with CUBA Platform security subsystem.\n- Access to files from external systems using static links.\n- REST API.\n\nFiles and versions are stored on top of the standard CUBA file storage, so there is no need for an external WebDAV server.\n\n## Automated migration\n\nIf you already have a file storage application and want to enhance it, use the migration tool included in the add-on. It enables or disables WebDAV support for existing file descriptors in your data model.\n\n## Installation\nPlease note that to install the add-on you must have the WebDAV add-on [subscription](https://www.cuba-platform.com/store/#/store/studio). \n\nFollow the [documentation](https://doc.cuba-platform.com/webdav-2.4/#_installation_via_cuba_studio) for installation instructions.\n\n## License\n\nThe add-on is licensed per company and includes:\n- Unlimited number of developers, servers, and projects.\n- Access to the source code repository.\n- The right to distribute the add-on as part of your applications without restrictions.\n- All upgrades during the subscription period.\n- The right to continue using previously downloaded versions after subscription expiry.\n\nThe pricing is reduced for individual developers. You can use Individual pricing if you are developing a project on your own (e.g. as a freelancer) and you are paying for Studio with personal funds. Individuals can acquire only one license key per account. \n\n## Links\n- [Documentation](https://doc.cuba-platform.com/webdav-2.4)\n- [Demo project](https://github.com/cuba-platform/webdav-demo)",

Being a part of the application, it enables seamless integration with the runtime application parts and visual process customizing. For example, to specify which service method should be invoked at a particular process step, you just need to select a Spring bean name and a method from a drop-down list.\n\nUsers may interact with running process instances using process forms. For simple cases, you can declare input dialogs right in the modeler. Also, you can use screens based on CUBA Generic UI to create process forms of any complexity.\n\n## Features\n- The embedded light-weight [Flowable](https://flowable.org) runtime engine. You are free to use the Flowable API directly, or you may use an API layer provided by the BProc addon.\n- Integrated BPMN 2.0 visual designer based on [bpmn.io](https://bpmn.io) framework.\n- Integrated DMN 1.1 decision table designer for complex decision logic.\n- Two types of process forms: \n       a) Input dialogs that can be created at runtime in the process modeler\n       b) Design-time defined CUBA screens\n- Administrative screens for managing running processes provide a ready solution to: \n       a) view all running process instances\n       b) reassign user tasks\n       c) modify process variables’ values\n       d) investigate failed jobs\n       e) analyze processes execution history, etc.\n- API for working with business processes from the code.\n\n## Installation\nPlease note that to install the add-on you must have the BProc add-on [subscription](https://www.cuba-platform.com/store/#/store/studio). \n\nFollow the [documentation](https://doc.cuba-platform.com/bproc-1.0/#_installation) for installation instructions.\n\n## License\n\nThe add-on is licensed per company and includes:\n\n- Unlimited number of developers, servers, and projects.\n- Access to the source code repository.\n- The right to distribute the add-on as part of your applications without restrictions.\n- All upgrades during the subscription period.\n- The right to continue using previously downloaded versions after subscription expiry.\n\nThe pricing is reduced for individual developers.

This is the mechanism that allows the _extsec_UserManagementService_ to be used before authentication, but can be leveraged by custom services too\n\nFor more information, please refer to [README](https://github.com/pfurini/cuba-component-forgot-password#cuba-forgot-password-component) on GitHub.",

      "description":"## Overview\nThis application component can be used for referencing entities without a foreign key in the database.\n\n## What is a soft reference?\nA soft reference is a reference in the data model, which does not create a foreign key in the database as well as not creating referential integrity for it. Instead, it is just a \"weak\" or \"soft\" reference to another entity.\n\n**Example: Customer - Order**\n\nLet's take the Customer <>--> Order example. A customer can have multiple orders. We model that as a composition in CUBA. This means, that there will be a column \"customer_id\" in the Order table, which stores the primary key of the customer in the Order Table. For every Order, there is a Customer associated with it.\n\nIn the soft reference example, this will be different. There will be a \"customer_id\" column as well in the Order table. But instead, there will be no foreign key association on the database. Instead the following String will be stored in this soft reference column: example $Customer-2fdc4906-fa89-11e7-8c3f-9a214cf093ae.\n\n### Foreign keys are valuable, why would someone not want to have them?\nCorrect. For pretty much every case, there is no need to use soft references. Since it misses all the cool features of referential integrity, there are a lot of downsides. Why do we still need them? Here is an example:\n\n**Example: Customer - Order - Comment**\n\nLet's assume we want to have a column called \"Comment\". Comments can be created for a lot of different entities. There can be comments for customers as well as comments for orders, products etc. The common way to handle that in a programming language like Java is that you would create an interface called Commentable. This interface marks all classes that want to be commentable as such. Then the Comment class could have a reference to a Commentable object. This is what polymorphism is all about.\n\nHowever - there is no native equivalent in a relational database. The reason is that when you want to create a foreign key, you need to point it to a destination table. But there is no generic table that you could point to. Instead, you want to point to totally different tables.\n\nFor cross cutting functionality, these soft references can be the solution here.",
